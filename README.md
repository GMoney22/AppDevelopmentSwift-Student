# Swift Textbook - Labs and Exercises

In April 2017, AppleÂ® released a [free textbook](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/app-development-with-swift/id1219117996?mt=11) that contains lessons, labs, and excercises. As I complete each subunit, I will upload my files here.

UPDATE 03/21: Archiving this repo.
